## iOS Resources

If you're new to Vungle, get started with the [dev guide](https://github.com/Vungle/vungle-resources/blob/master/iOS-resources/iOS-dev-guide.md).

Switching from an older version of the SDK ( < v3.0 )? Check out our [migration guide](https://github.com/Vungle/vungle-resources/blob/master/iOS-resources/iOS-migration-guide.md).

Once you've gotten an ad to play, our [advanced settings](https://github.com/Vungle/vungle-resources/blob/master/iOS-resources/iOS-advanced-settings.md) will help you customize the experience.

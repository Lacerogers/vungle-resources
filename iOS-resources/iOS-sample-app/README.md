Note that this copy of the sample app is missing Vungle's framework. If you'd like to run the sample app, add our framework to your project dirctory and to "Frameworks" in Xcode. The .embeddedframework directory should be added as a group (yellow folder) and not as a reference (blue folder).

Check out the AppDelegate and FirstViewController files to see an example integration of our SDK!

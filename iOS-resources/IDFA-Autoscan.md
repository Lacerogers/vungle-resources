# IDFA- Autoscan

## What is it?

In April 2014, Apple released a new feature called [Autoscan](http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/11/apple-developers-must-now-agree-to-ad-identifier-rules-or-risk-app-store-rejection/).Upon submission to the app store, this scanner will verify that your app complies with the guidelines outlined in the [iOS Developer Library](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AdSupport/Reference/ASIdentifierManager_Ref/ASIdentifierManager.html).

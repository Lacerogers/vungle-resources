### Upgrading to the Latest Version

We try to make upgrading to the latest version as easy as possible. Simply replace your ```VunglePub.jar``` or ```vungle-publisher-[version].jar``` file with the latest version and recompile!

And if you're upgrading from a version prior to 1.3.x, don't forget to add the new [service](http://bd.vungle.com/dev/android#service) element to your manifest.

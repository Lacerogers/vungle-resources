## Unity Resources

#### *** Please note: Our latest version of the Unity plugin requires Java 1.7 and the updates to the latest Android SDKs in order to work correctly. ***

If you are implementing our Unity plugin in an Android or iOS app, you can find separate docs for each. If you will be building for both, check out our combo doc.

Note that updating from a previous version will require deleting all of the Vungle jar files from the Plugins/Android folder before importing the new version!

# VungleSDK

Welcome to Vungle's resource hub!

Here you'll find developer guides and documentation for our newest SDK's (Version 3.0-(BETA) and up). 

We've also posted sample apps so you can get a look at some practical integration. Note that our SDK's are not open-sourced, so you'll have to download our sample apps [here (iOS)](https://v.vungle.com/dev/ios) and [here (Android)](https://v.vungle.com/dev/android) for the full versions.

If you encounter any issues, feel free to ping us at tech-support@vungle.com.

Cheers!
